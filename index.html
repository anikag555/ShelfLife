        <h1>ShelfLife: Predictive Novelty Purchase Timing</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction & Background</h2>
            <p>This project explores predictive analytics to identify when users are most likely to make novel purchases—items outside their regular staples. Our goal is to enhance retail strategies by predicting high-value shopping moments.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="problem">
            <h2>Problem & Motivation</h2>
            <p>Retailers often optimize for average behavior but miss potential profits from novelty behavior. We aim to forecast when deviations from standard purchase patterns are most likely to occur, using time-based features and user staples.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="team">
            <h2>Team Structure</h2>
            <p>The team is composed of two members: one focused on data engineering and pipeline orchestration, the other on ML model development and dashboard visualization.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="tech-stack">
            <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Docker: For containerization</li>
                <li>Databricks: For scalable ETL and ML training</li>
                <li>Spark ML & scikit-learn: For model training</li>
                <li>MLflow: Model tracking and deployment</li>
                <li>AKS: API orchestration and deployment</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="microservices">
            <h2>Microservices & Architecture</h2>
            <p>We deployed two microservices: a User Staples API and a Novelty Predict API. These communicate via internal endpoints within AKS. Below is a simplified architecture diagram:</p>

        <section id="dataset">
            <h2>Dataset & ETL</h2>
            <p>Data was sourced from Kaggle's Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset. We cleaned and split the data in Databricks, using Delta Tables for storage and Spark transformations for ETL.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="ml-model">
            <h2>ML Model</h2>
            <p>We used a RandomForestClassifier to predict novelty purchase timing based on hour and weekday. MLflow was used to track performance, with an AUC of 0.78 and F1-score of 0.72.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="api">
            <h2>REST APIs & Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><code>GET /user-staples</code>: Returns staple items</li>
                <li><code>POST /predict-novelty-time</code>: Returns novelty probability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Security includes basic JWT validation, error logging, and retry logic using Python’s requests library.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="dashboard">
            <h2>Dashboard & Monitoring</h2>
            <p>Our Streamlit dashboard visualizes novelty probabilities, time trends, and system health. Alerts are triggered on latency spikes and low-confidence predictions.</p>

        <section id="genai">
            <h2>GenAI Tool Reflection</h2>
            <p>OpenAI tools helped with debugging FastAPI, YAML scripting for AKS, and refining model insights. They improved efficiency but required careful verification for production use.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="frontend">
            <h2>Unified UI</h2>
            <p>Our UI provides a seamless user flow from login to prediction insights. Below are screenshots of key steps:</p>
